# Hackerrank challenges

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges of [HackerRank][1].

You can do whatever you want with them, except to use them as your own solutions
to the challenges.

# Building

You'll need [CMake][2] >=2.6.

Go to the source directory and

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make


The binaries are created in the `build/bin` directory.
